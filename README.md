#YoImages

Better image handling capabilities for Wordpress.
All you need to handle your images in Wordpress in one plugin.

No more images cropped wrong, you can choose now what to display and even replace the entire image for a specific crop size if the orginal image doesn't fit. Crop at a lower quality to speed up page loading.

Images are important for SEO but are never optimized enough. With YoImages you can automatically optimize images for Search Engines. No more alt tag missing or non informative titles or file names. Google can't see the image (yet) but, can read its attributes. 

YoImages adds functional enhancements to the Wordpress admin interface:
- image cropping tools
- image SEO hooks

##Image cropping tools

YoImages' cropping tools let you crop manually each cropping format that your theme defines: this feature gives you full control on how cropped versions of your images will look like.

You can choose to replace the source image for some specific formats.

From the image cropping interface you can change the image quality for each cropped format.

##Image SEO hooks

YoImages' SEO hooks automate image metadata (title, alt and filename) filling on image upload and on post (or page) saving.

Each image SEO hook can be enabled or disabled individually and it works on any image that is child of a post or page such as the featured image and images or galleries added into the post WYSIWG area.

You are free to define metadata values by using fixed texts and the following variables from the post/page that contains an image:
- post title
- post type
- site name
- post tags
- post categories
