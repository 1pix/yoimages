#YoImages

Better image handling capabilities for Wordpress. All you need to handle your images in Wordpress in one plugin. No more images cropped wrong, you can choose now what to display and even replace the entire image for a specific crop size if the orginal image doesn't fit. Crop at a lower quality to speed up page loading. 

YoImages adds functional enhancements to the Wordpress admin interface:
- image cropping tools
- image SEO hooks


##Image cropping tools


YoImages' cropping tools let you crop manually each cropping format that your theme defines: this feature gives you full control on how cropped versions of your images will look like.  [todo video]

You can choose to replace the source image for some specific formats [todo video]

From the image cropping interface you can change the image quality for each cropped format. [todo video]

##Image SEO hooks


YoImages' SEO hooks automate image metadata (title, alt and filename) population on image upload and on post (or page) saving.  [todo video]

You are free to define metadata values by using fixed texts and the following variables from the post/page that contains an image:
- post title
- post type
- site name
- post tags
- post categories

[todo video]

Each image SEO hook can be enabled or disabled individually.  [todo video]

- direct search of royalty free images
- mini built-in image editor (effects, editing, color optimization)
