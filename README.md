#YoImages

Better image handling capabilities for Wordpress.

YoImages adds functional enhancements to the Wordpress admin interface:
- image cropping tools
- image SEO hooks


##Image cropping tools


YoImages' cropping tools let you crop manually each cropping format that your theme defines: this feature gives you full control on how cropped versions of your images will look like.  [todo video]

You can choose to replace the source image for some specific formats [todo video]

From the image cropping interface you can change the image quality for each cropped format. [todo video]

##Image SEO hooks


YoImages' SEO hooks automate image metadata (title, alt and filename) population on image upload and on post (or page) saving.  [todo video]

You are free to define metadata values by using fixed texts and the following variables from the post/page that contains an image:
- post title
- post type
- site name
- post tags
- post categories

[todo video]

Each image SEO hook can be enabled or disabled individually.  [todo video]
